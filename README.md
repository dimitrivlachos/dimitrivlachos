### üåü About Me
I am a **Software Scientist** at the UK's national synchrotron particle accelerator, [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html). My professional focus is on developing **GPU-based analysis algorithms** with **CUDA** for x-ray diffraction data. I work on **real-time fast feedback services** to support beamline experiments and contribute to accelerated data processing tools, including the [DIALS](https://dials.github.io/) project.

With a **First-Class Honours degree in Computer Science** from the University of London, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of science and technology. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously seek opportunities to **learn, innovate**, and **create impactful solutions**.
